                    One of our favorite things about Chicago is its many neighborhoods - 
                    each comes with its own unique charm and history. We encourage you to book 
                    accommodations in the neighborhood best interests you. To help you out,
                    we have provided some suggestions below:

                    Please note that we will not be reserving an official hotel block 
                    as our venue is located away from downtown Chicago where most large hotels 
                    are situated.

                    Getting around Chicago is easy! You definitely do not need to rent a car if you don't 
                    want to. Public transit is safe and plentiful. The neighborhoods are all quite walkable.

                        special day. Your effort and presence mean the world to us!

                        For those flying in Chicago is served by two major airports: 
                        O'Hare International Airport (ORD) and Midway International Airport (MDW). 
                        Both airports are well-connected to the city via public transit, taxis, 
                        and ride-sharing services.

                        Please note that starting May 7, 2025, all guests flying will need a 
                        REAL ID-compliant driver's license or another acceptable form of 
                        identification (ex. passport) to board domestic flights within the US. 
                        Make sure to check your ID and upgrade if necessary to avoid any travel issues.

                                Chicago’s buses are safe and run fairly regularly. Taking the bus may be most convenient for those staying along or near Irving Park Ave and Western Ave.

                                Unfortunately, the River Room is not located near any El stops. While the train is a great way to get around the city, they are not the best for our venue.
                                Your best bet would be to take the Brown or Blue Line to their respective Irving Park stops and transfer to a bus or use a ride-sharing service from there.
